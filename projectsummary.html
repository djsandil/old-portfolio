        <!-- Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of your findings.  Be sure to include insights from conducting your research and tests as well as any challenges faced.  If you are not quite sure of what conclusions can be drawn, pose a hypothesis as to possible solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved. -->
        <p> When I conducted my user research, I wanted to address my main concerns when making a portfolio. Some of these concerns were: what content should I add, how should I format the content, what do people actually want to see and view, and how to personalize it to represent who I am. I created numerous sketches and wireframes on how I wanted my portfolio to look like before coding, and my user interviews and competitive analysis really helped organize the content I wanted to display. So I thought I was pretty confident about how I was going to make my website, and make it my style. However, there were definitely obstacles I faced while creating the basis of my website.
        <br><br> 
        I have no web development experience, other than working on Wordpress and Weebly for student organizations or assignments, but never really looked into depth on the HTML/CSS/Javascript. So this class is my first time working on a website from scratch only using HTML/CSS/Javascript. I did CodeAcademy and reviewed the lecture slides for HTML/CSS/Javascript to help further my understanding, and paced myself so I wouldn't procrastinate. I realized that when your designing, it's always trial and error. There were things that I thought it looked amazing when I first sketch it and brainstorm ideas, such as my personal logo and color scheme because it made it feel like it's me, but when I showed it to other people, opinions would vary between pros and cons (which will go further in depth in the next section). In addition, this is the first time I had first-hand experience with working on responsive design and how to get it to work properly for the correct display size. It was still a confusing topic because at first my website seemed to look fine without making adjustments, but when I started to add more content and images that's when I noticed changes. 
        <br><br>
        Other obstacles I have faced is the layout for the content and the content itself. My content was the first thing I tackled first, because that's the main purpose people would want to view on your portfolio and I wanted that to be solid and concrete. I included an "About Me", "Featured Work", "Activities" and "Contact" section for my main four sections of my website. I treated my portfolio as an online-resume, therefore, it would describe my character, what kind of experience do I have and what was I involved in. This was also the main information my user interviews would say they want to see on a portfolio because they wanted a well-rounded individual. If any potential user was interested in learning more about me or hire me for a job, I included the contact section which contains my email, LinkedIn and my GitHub account. 
        <br><br>
        Later on, I tried to think what is the best way to display this information to others that's both engaging, interesting and brings out my personality. From my user research, I've seen people have a single- or multiple- paged portfolio and they had interesting features throughout their whole website. Other people had included sections on the home page that highlights key information, and then clicking on a project/section leads you to a new page of information. There were various design choices to make and I wasn't sure which one to use for myself. I originally sketched a multipage layout, but after realizing what seemed "easier" and more "user-friendly", I stuck with a single-page portfolio. It allows the users to roam freely on the website and that's what I want the user to do-- explore. In the next section, I will go more in depth on how I incorporated my findings into my website.

        </p>
        
        <h1> Incorporation of Findings </h1>
        <hr>
        <!-- Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of how you incorporated findings and/or how you plan to incorporate findings.  Be sure to include any challenges faced and how you arrived at solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved and you actually took steps or plant to take steps to improve it.  -->
        <p> To go more in depth with my findings and how I incorporated it into my website, I decided to split up this section for results and incorporation. To me, this structure seemed the best way to describe the base website and the changes I made after I did user testing. </p>
        <h2> Results from User Research </h2>
            <p> In my user research, everyone's portfolio or comments about the portfolio were pretty similar. They would want to see who you are, what projects have you worked on, and a way to contact you. The projects section would be a new page, that contained more detailed information on what you did, how you worked on it and a reflection of what you learned from doing the project. Some websites also included additional information, such as, the user's blog posts or photography to demonstrate their skills. Based off these results, I wanted to think how much could I display and what could I display for my portfolio.
            </p>
        <h2> Incorporation of Findings from User Research </h2>
            <p>
            As I said earlier, I broke down my sections to an "About Me", "Featured Works", "Activities and Leadership" and "Contact" section. This was overall common themes that were on other portfolios, except for featured works and activities. The featured works section is originally supposed to show the most recent works I've done by having a brief description, and then there will be a button that will view more details about that project. I included this section, because I thought it would appeal to the audience more if they saw a brief description on the home page first before viewing more information. The activities and leadership section I included because it revolved my activities in the ICS communities at UCI. Unfortunately, most of my projects aren't "finished" or in a format I would like to display it on my current portfolio, and I wanted to show I'm well-rounded or experienced. Therefore, I added this section to show that I have leadership/mentor qualities.
            <br><br>
            My inspiration on how I arranged my content on a single-page website is based off one of my competitor's I used for my competitor analysis. His website was very clean that included a description of himself, the projects he has worked on, and the ways to contact him. What really made his website interesting, was that each section was a different color, and the colors represent his personality. That inspired me to try to base my color scheme on how everyone view's me as a person and my personality. However, on his website there was no navigation, or a way to jump to certain sections so that was something I thought that was something I wanted to add.
            <br><br>
            For my original website, it supposed to have this idea that you can preview information before viewing more because it's supposed to act just like a homepage. The navigation/headings had different colors for the to represent my personality on a single-colored background. I chose to do a side navigation because as I browsed through navigation styles this particular CSS animation stood out to me. It was something simple and interactive enough to make it stand out, but not distract the user too much from the content. I ordered my content based on what I thought was the most important and logical way to get to know a person, so I did the description about myself followed by my projects, activities and contact sections. There was also a lot of recommendations to add smooth scrolling to sections and to the page in general so it could be a smooth transition, so I tried to look into that for my website. 
            </p>
        <h2> Results from User Testing </h2>
            <p> When my website was finished it's for iteration and went out for testing, it had a mixture of feedback. Most people said the purpose was clear about what my portfolio was and straightforward on where to find information, but they would like to see more information about what I've worked on and a professional photo. Other's mentioned that there was too many colors, and not all of them worked well-together, even though it was supposed to represent my personality. 
            <br><br>
            Another question I asked about my website was about the layout because I originally had two different layouts in mind for my website. One of them is the current website, where you can scroll to each section or jump to each section on a single page. The other layout was supposed to hide the different sections, and they would appear after you clicked on the navigation. At first I thought the hiding/reappearing sections was really nice and smooth, but when I asked my testers they said they enjoyed a single-page to scroll through is more user-friendly and less tedious. 
            </p>
        <h2> Incorporation of Findings from User Testing</h2>
            <p>
            After the user testing, the first thing I did was replace my photo with a professional one and change the color scheme. It's still using some of the colors I originally had, but now it should be more balanced. As for my photo, I was in luck because one of my student organizations needed to retake their professional photos so that's why I replaced it. I didn't originally have the smooth scrolling to each section, so I added that for this final iteration for this website. The navigation position used to be absolute, but has now changed to fixed to make it less tedious on scrolling back all the way to top to go to another section. I've changed the featured work section just a bit, so now it includes this project summary page and the other project I'm working on to demonstrate what the layout should be looking like if I had more content. 
            </p>
        <h2> Reflection </h2>
            <p> Overall, making a website from scratch gave me experience about how to approach UI/UX design for front-end web development. I discouraged myself from trying to use Bootstrap or Foundation because I wanted to challenge myself to make a simple and informative website with some sort of interesting interaction, that's different from what's common. This class helped me work on something that I had been putting off because of the lack of time, so I feel somewhat satisfied for my final product for this course and hope to improve in the future by arranging it in a way that suits my character and fix the responsive design. </p>

            <h2> User Interviews </h2>
            <img class="imginterview" src="images/UserInterview.png" width=225 height=250>
            <p> User interviews are interviews with stakeholders to help identify key objectives and goals. These interviews are important because it allows you to understand what potential clients will be looking for when they view your product. Some questions I asked during my user interview were: what were things you didn't want to see on a portfolio, how do you personalize your portfolio to reflect your personality, and what kind of things do you expect to see on a portfolio. Based off their responses, I tried to arrange my content according to what they saw as a "priority" and made design decisions that can represent my character. </p>

        <h2> Competitor Analysis </h2>
            <img class="imgcompanalysis" src="images/CompetitorAnalysis.jpg" width=225 height=250>
            <p> Competitor analysis (or competitor evaluations) is when you see what your competitors are doing, how they're doing it, what's working and what's not working out. For my competitor analysis, I looked through 2 student portfolios and one random professional portfolio. Since I'm a senior undergraduate looking for full-time/part-time/internships, looking at student portfolios made sense because that would be my competition for jobs. Therefore, I wanted to view how they organized their content or what information are they displaying to make themselves standout. For the professional portfolio, it was more out of curiosity about their structure, and how does someone in the industry appeal themselves to potential employers. </p>

        <h2> Feature Value Matrix </h2>
            <img class="imgfvm" src="images/Feature%20Value%20Matrix.png" width=225 height=250>
            <p> The feature value matrix is used to define feature sets in terms of basic, delightful, and performance. The feature value matrix helps sort out what features should I prioritize by the business, user and technical values. With the feature value matrix, it helped me realized what were things within scope and easy to do, and what might take more time to work on. </p>

            <p> For the feature prioritization, I organized things accordingly on what was high priority and low priority. For my portfolio, I focused heavily on the content and color, rather than animations because I wanted to be more informative and make sure my content is concrete rather than  impress them with animation/aesthetics. Coding could be a challenge, and I want to be known for my content, not for my aesthetic. </p>

        <p> A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why they want it. For the user stories, I tried to think about the different personas that would be looking at my portfolio and the impression I wanted to leave on them after they viewed my website. I want my portfolio to be simple and straightforward to the user where they can find all the information they want to know and engage in small eye-catching interactions. </p>

        <img class="imgcw" src="images/CogWalkthrough.jpg" width=225 height=250>
        <p> A cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which one or more evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user. A cognitive walkthrough is important because it's a way of viewing how people do tasks. This helps catch for different ways people approach the current design and how you can refine your design based on their actions. For my cognitive walkthrough, the biggest challenge was trying to think of tasks for the user to do that would be "challenging" because my website is easy to look through for information. So I tried to explain an alternative layout of how I would have my design, and which layout seemed more "user-friendly."  </p>

        <p> Summary about the types of tests conducted and why you chose them. Make sure to include any challenges faced.  You can summarize the test results as well. Be short and to the point. For the usability testing, I wanted to see if my "About Me" section had too much text, so I conducted the 5 second test. This test showed the "About Me" section and I wanted them to try to memorize as much as they could. Afterwards, the users were asked to name a technical and non-technical skill, and if images was better to display the skills. Another test I conducted was where they would click after being shown the top section with all the tabs pulled out. I wanted to see which tab was the one they are most interested in. As for the results of the testing, most people said they were most curious "About Me" and "Work" experience to see what type of person I am, and what I have worked on. In addition, they would want to see images or a table for technical and non-technical skills. </p>
