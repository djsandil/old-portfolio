	Portfolios had shown featured work or only their work first before a description of themselves.

	<h2><a id="about"> About Me </a></h2>
	<p> 
	Hi there! I'm currently a Senior at the University of California, Irvine,
	studying Informatics with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI). 
	I'm an aspiring UX Designer, and I hope to design products that create a positive
	impact on the world so that I can give back to the community that made me who I am today. 
	
	<br><br>
	Technical Skills: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	Non-technical Skills: Sketching, LucidChart, Moqups, Adobe Experience Design(XD) CC
	
	<br><br> 
	On a more personal note, I'm a casual PC/Console gamer that enjoys watching anime and
	Korean dramas. In my free time, I'm either gaming, sketching new ideas, hanging out with
	friends or family, or walking around while listening to music. </p>
